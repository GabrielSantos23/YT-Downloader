# YouTube Downloader - Distribution Guide

## 🎉 Success! Your Application is Ready for Distribution

Your YouTube Downloader application has been successfully built into executable files that can be distributed to users. Here's what you have and how to use it.

## 📦 What You Have

### Executables Created:

- **`YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe`** (48.4 MB) - The installer that checks for FFmpeg
- **`YouTubeDownloader.exe`** (55.0 MB) - The main application
- **`YouTubeDownloader_Package/`** - Complete distribution package

### Package Contents:

```
YouTubeDownloader_Package/
├── YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe
├── YouTubeDownloader.exe
└── README.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Distribute

### Option 1: Share the Complete Package (Recommended)

1. Zip the entire `YouTubeDownloader_Package` folder
2. Share the zip file with your users
3. Users extract and run `YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe` first

### Option 2: Share Individual Files

1. Share `YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe` and `YouTubeDownloader.exe` separately
2. Include instructions for users to run the setup first

## 👥 User Installation Process

### Step 1: Run the Installer

Users should run `YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe` first. The installer will:

1. **Check for FFmpeg** in multiple locations:

   - System PATH
   - Local `.ffmpeg` directory
   - Environment variables

2. **If FFmpeg is found:**

   - Setup completes immediately
   - User can proceed to run the main application

3. **If FFmpeg is missing:**

   - Offers to download and install FFmpeg automatically
   - Shows progress bar during download
   - Installs to local `.ffmpeg` directory
   - Sets up environment variables

4. **If user skips FFmpeg installation:**
   - Shows clear warning about FFmpeg requirement
   - Provides manual installation instructions
   - Explains alternative installation methods

### Step 2: Run the Application

After setup, users run `YouTubeDownloader.exe` to use the application.

## 🛠️ Build Process

### Quick Build:

```bash
# Option 1: Use batch file
build.bat

# Option 2: Manual build
python build_installer.py

### What the Build Process Does:

1. **Installs PyInstaller** if not present
2. **Builds installer** (`YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe`)
3. **Builds main app** (`YouTubeDownloader.exe`)
4. **Creates package** with both executables
5. **Generates README** with user instructions

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Your Build:

```bash
python test_installer.py
```

This will test:

- ✅ FFmpeg detection logic
- ✅ Executable file creation
- ✅ FFmpeg download URL accessibility

### Manual Testing:

1. Run `YouTubeDownloader_Setup.exe` on a clean machine
2. Test FFmpeg detection and installation
3. Run `YouTubeDownloader.exe` to verify the main app works
